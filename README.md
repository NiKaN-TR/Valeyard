 A bot written in PHP which attempts to link IRC with SQL database, allowing for integration between platforms.

 So far this bot supports:

  - [Writing various stats and information from UnrealIRCd to its own SQL tables](https://github.com/ValwareIRC/Valeyard/tree/main/src/unrealircd)
  - [Reading and writing to WordPress SQLdb user tables (more to come)](https://github.com/ValwareIRC/Valeyard/tree/main/src/wordpress)
